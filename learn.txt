I feel that Devclub is an interactive environment where students can brainstorm ideas to create new products. It provides a simple and easy way of learning new things and applying the new skills obtained simultaneously. I personally hope to take my web development skills to the next level and improve upon my backend coding skills. I also want to learn app development. 

Just adding some test text.
